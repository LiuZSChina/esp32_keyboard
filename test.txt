removed delay
and shut down wdt
seems fine 
funny
try to set baud rate higher
seems often get double click?
20220525
if we should get a delay to eliminate the double click?
do it or not?
return seems to have a lot of problem
one millisecond of delay worked good!
change baud rate to 

115200?
naa ye millisecond
test passed!

ok report rate goes up to 1000hz, with delaying only one millisecond
seems faster in responding ! more hand catching
test passed!
